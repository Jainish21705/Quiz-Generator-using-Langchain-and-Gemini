## üîç Key Components

### QuizParser Class
Custom output parser that extracts structured quiz data from AI responses using regex patterns:
- Parses questions with numbered tags
- Extracts multiple-choice options
- Matches correct answers to questions

### Quiz Generation Chain
Langchain pipeline that combines:
- **PromptTemplate**: Structured prompt for consistent quiz format
- **Gemini LLM**: Google's language model for content generation
- **Custom Parser**: Processes AI output into usable quiz format

### State Management
Streamlit session state handles:
- Quiz data persistence
- User answer tracking
- Score calculation
- Generation history for uniqueness

## üéØ Features in Detail

### Intelligent Question Generation
- **Uniqueness Tracking**: Prevents duplicate questions across generations
- **Context-Aware**: Generates questions specific to your input topic
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjusts question complexity based on selected level
- **Format Consistency**: Ensures proper multiple-choice structure

### Interactive Feedback System
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on answer selection
- **Color-coded Responses**: Green for correct, red for incorrect
- **Correct Answer Display**: Shows the right answer for wrong selections
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicator

### Scoring System
- **Percentage Calculation**: Shows score as both fraction and percentage
- **Performance Categories**: 
  - Excellent (‚â•80%): Balloon celebration + success message
  - Good (‚â•60%): Encouraging success message
  - Needs Improvement (<60%): Motivational message

## üîí Security & Best Practices

- Environment variables for API key management
- Error handling for API failures
- Input validation for user inputs
- Session state management for data persistence

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**
   - Ensure `.env` file exists with correct `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - Verify API key is valid and has sufficient quota

2. **Quiz Generation Fails**
   - Check internet connection
   - Try with simpler topic context
   - Reduce number of questions

3. **Parsing Errors**
   - Usually resolved by regenerating the quiz
   - Check if topic context is clear and specific
